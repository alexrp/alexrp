Hello!

I write open source software projects in my spare time. Projects I create will
always be available free of charge and under very permissive licenses (e.g.
[ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) or
[MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).

Here are some of the projects I work on:

* **[Alkahest](https://github.com/tera-alkahest):** An extensible TERA proxy
  server.
* **[Augmentrex](https://github.com/alexrp/augmentrex):** A reverse engineering
  tool for the Steam version of Hellgate: London.
* **[Flare](https://github.com/flare-lang):** A dynamic programming language
  suitable for embedding.
* **[Mono](https://github.com/mono/mono):** Open source implementation of C#,
  CLI, and .NET.
* **[SDB](https://github.com/mono/sdb):** A command line client for the Mono
  soft debugger.
* **[System.Terminal](https://github.com/alexrp/system-terminal):** A
  terminal-centric replacement for System.Console.

I occasionally write blog articles that are occasionally interesting:

* [Untangling .NET Atomics: Defining Terms](https://alexrp.com/untangling-dotnet-atomics-defining-terms)
* [Untangling .NET Atomics: The Status Quo](https://alexrp.com/untangling-dotnet-atomics-the-status-quo)

If you like the software I work on and would like to support me financially so
that I can continue that work, please consider [sponsoring
me](https://github.com/sponsors/alexrp)!
