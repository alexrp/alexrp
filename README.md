Hello!

I write open source software projects in my spare time. Projects I create will
always be available free of charge and under very permissive licenses (e.g.
[ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) or
[MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).

Here are some of the projects I currently work on:

* **[Flare](https://github.com/flare-lang):** A dynamic programming language
  suitable for embedding.
* **[Mono](https://github.com/mono/mono):** Open source implementation of C#,
  CLI, and .NET.
* **[SDB](https://github.com/mono/sdb):** A command line client for the Mono
  soft debugger.
* **[Seiiki](https://github.com/seiiki-dev/seiiki):** A walled garden where all
  is right with the world.
