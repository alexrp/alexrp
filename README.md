Hello!

I write open source software projects in my spare time. Projects I create will
always be available free of charge and under very permissive licenses such as
[0BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/0BSD).

[My personal website](https://alexrp.com) contains my resume, technical notes,
and articles.
