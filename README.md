Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex RÃ¸nne Petersen, a self-taught software engineer living in
Denmark.

I like to work on open source projects, particularly ones relating to
programming languages, compilers, virtual machines, and reverse engineering. I
also dabble in terminal applications and kernel development.

I currently manage the open source software organization
[Vezel](https://vezel.dev) and lead the development of its various projects. I'm
also a [Zig](https://ziglang.org) core team member. Previously, I worked on
[Mono](https://www.mono-project.com) for Xamarin (and later Microsoft).

Projects I create will always be available free of charge and under very
permissive licenses such as [0BSD](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd). If you
like the software I work on and would like to support me financially so that I
can continue that work, please consider
[sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/alexrp)!
