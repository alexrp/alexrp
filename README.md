Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I like to work on open source projects, particularly ones relating to
programming languages, virtual machines, and terminal applications. I do some
occasional reverse engineering and game programming too. I've also ventured
into kernel land a few times.

I manage the non-profit, open source software organization
[Vezel](https://vezel.dev).

Projects I create will always be available free of charge and under very
permissive licenses such as [0BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/0BSD). If you
like the software I work on and would like to support me financially so that I
can continue that work, please consider
[sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/alexrp)!
